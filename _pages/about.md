## About Me

Hi, I’m **Peixian Zhang**, a PhD Candidate in Information Hub at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) supervised by Gareth Tyson.
I am broadly interested in social computing, including social networks, internet measurement, and, more recently, how AI- and LLM-generated content influences users’ online experiences.
